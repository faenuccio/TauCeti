# The tautological action of the diffeomorphism group

The self-diffeomorphism group `M ≃ₘ^n⟮I, I⟯ M` acts on the underlying manifold by evaluation:
`φ • x = φ x`. This file records that action, its faithfulness, and continuity in the point.

The action formalization mirrors `TauCeti.Homeomorph.applyMulAction` in
`TauCeti.Topology.Algebra.HomeomorphAction`,
which in turn follows `Equiv.Perm.applyMulAction` and the construction in Kim Morrison's
mathlib4#40135.

This is a small prerequisite for the geometric-topology roadmap
(`TauCetiRoadmap/GeometricTopology/README.md`, layer 3, "diffeomorphism groups with the C^∞
topology"). The layer builds `Diff(M)` as a group first and then equips it with the `C^∞`
topology; the evaluation action and the map `Diff(M) → Homeomorph(M)` are basic API for relating
that future topological group to the underlying space.

## Main definitions

* `TauCeti.Diffeomorph.applyMulAction`: the `MulAction (M ≃ₘ^n⟮I, I⟯ M) M` with
  `φ • x = φ x`.
* `TauCeti.Diffeomorph.applyFaithfulSMul`: the action is faithful.
* `TauCeti.Diffeomorph.applyContinuousConstSMul`: each diffeomorphism acts continuously.
* `TauCeti.Diffeomorph.applySubgroupContinuousConstSMul`: subgroups inherit continuity in the
  point.
